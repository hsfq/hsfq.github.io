# Toncoin Price Hits Two-Year High as Telegram Considers IPO  

The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant surge in Toncoin (TON) value following revelations about Telegram's potential plans for an initial public offering (IPO). This development has reignited investor interest in The Open Network ecosystem, creating a ripple effect across blockchain and digital asset markets. Let's explore the factors driving this momentum and what it means for crypto enthusiasts and blockchain developers.

## The Connection Between Telegram and TON  

Founded in 2017 as the Telegram Open Network, TON initially gained attention as a blockchain project backed by the popular messaging platform. However, regulatory challenges led Telegram to abandon direct involvement in 2020. Despite this separation, the network continued evolving independently, maintaining its core infrastructure while developing new use cases.  

The renewed connection between Telegram and TON has become increasingly apparent through recent integrations and strategic initiatives. Telegram's 900 million monthly users now interact with blockchain features directly within the app, creating unprecedented exposure for decentralized technologies. This seamless integration has positioned TON as a critical player in the blockchain-as-a-service landscape, bridging traditional digital platforms with Web3 capabilities.

## Market Response to Telegram's IPO Signals  

Following reports about Telegram's potential IPO, Toncoin experienced a dramatic price surge, reaching $3.84 per token â€“ the highest level since December 2021. This represents a remarkable 38% increase within 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency maintaining a 19% gain over the subsequent period.  

The market reaction demonstrates investors' confidence in Telegram's vision for blockchain integration and financial independence. Key metrics showing TON's performance include:  

| Timeframe        | Price Increase |  
|-------------------|----------------|  
| 24 Hours          | 19%            |  
| 7 Days            | 37%            |  
| 30 Days           | 75%            |  

This sustained growth pattern suggests long-term adoption potential rather than short-lived speculation.

## Telegram's Strategic Monetization Plan  

Telegram founder Pavel Durov emphasized the platform's commitment to maintaining independence while achieving profitability. With annual revenue exceeding hundreds of millions from subscriptions and advertising, the company has rejected multiple investment offers valuing it at $30 billion or more.  

Durov explained the strategic approach: "The main reason why we started to monetize is because we wanted to remain independent." This philosophy aligns with Telegram's decentralized vision, where users benefit from platform growth through token-based rewards rather than traditional equity structures.  

The platform's monetization strategy includes:  
- **Crypto-native advertising**: Revenue sharing with channel owners through Toncoin  
- **Integrated financial tools**: In-app crypto wallet functionality for seamless transactions  
- **Community-driven growth**: Gamified engagement models that reward active participation

## Notcoin: A Gateway to Mass Adoption  

The recent success of Notcoin, a tap-based game within Telegram with 27 million players, demonstrates the platform's potential to introduce blockchain concepts to mainstream audiences. This gamified approach to user engagement has created a natural pipeline for new crypto users, with an upcoming token airdrop set to distribute rewards through The Open Network.  

Notcoin's significance lies in its ability to:  
1. Simplify blockchain interaction through familiar gaming mechanics  
2. Build community around token distribution models  
3. Demonstrate real-world utility for cryptocurrencies  

The game's planned migration to TON represents a critical test case for blockchain scalability and user adoption strategies.  

## Technical Developments Driving Adoption  

Telegram's integration of a self-custody crypto wallet within its platform has significantly lowered entry barriers for new users. This native wallet solution enables seamless transactions without requiring technical expertise, addressing one of the major adoption challenges in the crypto space.  

Key technical advantages include:  
- **Instant transaction processing**: Optimized for high-volume, low-value transfers  
- **Multi-layer security**: Combining Telegram's infrastructure with blockchain verification  
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Supporting both mobile and desktop environments  

These features position The Open Network as a viable solution for microtransactions and everyday digital payments.
