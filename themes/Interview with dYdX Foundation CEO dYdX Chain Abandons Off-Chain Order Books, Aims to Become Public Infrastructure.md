# Interview with dYdX Foundation CEO: dYdX Chain Abandons Off-Chain Order Books, Aims to Become Public Infrastructure  

## dYdX Chain: A New Era of Decentralized Derivatives Trading  

On October 27, dYdX Chain launched its mainnet, creating its genesis block at 1:00 AM. Charles d'Haussy, CEO of the dYdX Foundation, described this milestone as "a giant leap for the dYdX ecosystem, marking a new chapter of full decentralization." In a recent interview, d'Haussy provided insights into dYdX Chainâ€™s design, future vision, and the state of crypto. He also revealed that dYdX has achieved $1 trillion in trading volume since its inception, capturing approximately 1% of global derivatives trading volume. The CEO forecasts this share could eventually rise to **7%**.  

### Transition to Cosmos SDK-Based Architecture  

dYdX Trading, the primary developer behind dYdX, announced the open-sourcing of its v4 codebase on October 24, signaling the start of the v4 upgrade. This upgrade introduces **dYdX Chain**, a standalone Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. Unlike its predecessor, which relied on off-chain order books hosted on AWS, dYdX Chain integrates the order book directly into validator memory, eliminating the need for block confirmations.  

The new architecture positions dYdX Chain as a decentralized, community-governed platform secured by audited smart contracts. Key phases of its post-genesis development include:  

- **Alpha Phase**: Focuses on bridging, staking, and security. The goal is to ensure economic balance by maintaining staked DYDX token value above the networkâ€™s on-chain liquidity.  
- **Beta Phase**: Introduces trading functionality without rewards, integrating traders, liquidity providers (LPs), and system components.  

dYdX Trading plans to relinquish control over protocol components, transferring governance entirely to stakeholders. This shift aligns with the CEOâ€™s vision: "dYdX chooses DeFiâ€”not half-DeFi or half-CeFi. We aim to become a public good, a public infrastructure."

## Expanding DeFiâ€™s Market Share: From 1% to 7%  

Charles d'Haussy drew parallels between dYdXâ€™s trajectory and Uniswapâ€™s rise in spot markets. While dYdX currently holds 1% of crypto derivatives trading volume, the CEO believes this could expand to **7%**, mirroring Uniswapâ€™s 5â€“7% dominance in spot trading.  

### Key Drivers for Growth:  
1. **Flexibility in Access**: Users interact with dYdX via mobile apps, desktop interfaces, or APIs, reflecting a shift from single-entry points to multi-channel engagement.  
2. **Infrastructure-as-a-Protocol Model**: Like Compound, dYdX is evolving into a foundational protocol accessible through centralized exchanges, insurance products, or third-party platforms.  

## CeFi Regulation: A Catalyst for DeFi Adoption  

The CEO acknowledged the inevitability of CeFi regulation, predicting centralized exchanges will soon require licenses for spot trading. While supporting responsible oversight, d'Haussy emphasized dYdXâ€™s cautious approach: "We work closely with legal advisors to ensure compliance for projects joining our ecosystem."  

This regulatory pressure could accelerate DeFiâ€™s rise, creating a "DeFi mullet" combining traditional finance (front-end) with decentralized infrastructure (back-end). d'Haussy noted: "FTXâ€™s collapse highlighted CeFiâ€™s fragility, driving users toward protocols like Curve and dYdX."  

### FAQs on dYdX Chainâ€™s Evolution  

**Q: Why did dYdX abandon off-chain order books?**  
A: To achieve full decentralization. Storing order books in validator memory ensures trustless execution without relying on centralized infrastructure.  

**Q: How does the Cosmos SDK benefit dYdX Chain?**  
A: Cosmos enables interoperability and scalability, critical for handling high-frequency derivatives trading while maintaining security.  

**Q: What role does DYDX staking play?**  
A: Staking secures the network and ensures economic balance, with the target of staked DYDX value exceeding on-chain liquidity.

## Bear Market Resilience: Cryptoâ€™s Institutional Maturation  

Reflecting on earlier bear markets, d'Haussy highlighted cryptoâ€™s increased resilience: "Todayâ€™s bear market is less destructive. Projects now have multi-year funding reserves and continue building despite volatility."  

### Macro-Economic Integration:  
- Crypto markets are now intertwined with global economic trends, attracting institutional participation.  
- The collapse of FTX and other CeFi entities has accelerated migration to decentralized alternatives like dYdX.  

## Lessons from the Internetâ€™s Early Days  

d'Haussy compared blockchainâ€™s regulatory challenges to the internetâ€™s infancy: "Initial fears around drugs and terrorism faded as operators established guidelines. Similarly, blockchain regulation should focus on behavior, not technology itself."  

## Conclusion: dYdXâ€™s Vision as a Public Good  

With its transition to a fully decentralized infrastructure, dYdX aims to redefine derivatives trading. By prioritizing community governance, security, and accessibility, the platform seeks to cement its role as a foundational pillar of DeFi.
