## DASH/USD Short-Term Analysis

### Chart Pattern Breakdown

The symmetrical triangle pattern identified on October 11, 2018, has now been decisively breached. This technical development triggered a rapid decline toward the critical $150.31 support level, derived from the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement of the August 14 - September 2, 2018 bullish run (from $128.36 to $230.29).

### Resistance Dynamics

Current price action faces dual resistance from:
1. Long-term downtrend line at $167.39
2. 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level

A successful breach above this confluence zone would open pathways toward:
- $179.38 (0.5 Fibonacci)
- $191.38 (0.382 Fibonacci)
- $206.22 (0.236 Fibonacci)

### Extended Bullish Scenario

Should buyers overcome the $230.29 September high, Fibonacci extensions project additional resistance at:
- $257.45 (1.272 extension)
- $271.25 (1.414 extension)
- $291.08 (1.618 extension)

### Bearish Contingency

Failure to maintain $150.31 support risks:
1. Immediate support at $140.12 (0.886 retracement)
2. Critical $128.36 psychological level (August 2018 lows)
