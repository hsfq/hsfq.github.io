## Understanding Altcoin Margin Trading

Margin trading in cryptocurrency operates through **derivatives contracts** (CFDs) rather than direct ownership of digital assets. Traders speculate on price movements against fiat currencies or stablecoins, with positions amplified by leverage ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:100. Key considerations include:

- **Collateral Requirements**: Most platforms require BTC, ETH, or stablecoins as margin deposits
- **Trading Mechanics**: Positions reflect price differences without asset ownership
- **Jurisdictional Restrictions**: US residents face limitations on derivative trading
