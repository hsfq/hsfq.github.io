## Understanding Cryptocurrency Exchange Platforms  

### Centralized vs. Decentralized Exchanges  
Cryptocurrency exchanges fall into two primary categories:  

| Feature                | Centralized Exchanges (CEX)          | Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)        |  
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Control**            | Managed by single entity             | Autonomous, governed by smart contracts |  
| **Liquidity**          | High (e.g., Binance, Coinbase)       | Lower (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap)     |  
| **Security Risks**     | Higher (centralized databases)       | Lower (non-custodial transactions)   |  
| **Transaction Fees**   | Typically lower                      | Often higher due to network congestion |  

**FAQ 1: Which exchange type is better for beginners?**  
Centralized exchanges offer user-friendly interfaces and robust liquidity, making them ideal for novice traders. Decentralized platforms prioritize security and privacy but may require technical expertise.
