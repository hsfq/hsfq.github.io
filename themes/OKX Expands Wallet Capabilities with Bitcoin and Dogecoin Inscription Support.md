## Understanding Inscription Standards  

Inscriptions are a groundbreaking innovation in blockchain technology, allowing metadata such as text, images, and even video to be directly embedded onto a blockchain. Unlike traditional NFTs, which often rely on off-chain storage solutions, inscriptions are entirely on-chain, ensuring greater permanence and decentralization.  

### Key Inscription Standards Supported by OKX  
| Standard      | Blockchain    | Key Features                          |  
|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|

| **SRC-20**    | Bitcoin       | Enables Stamps-based token creation   |  
| **DRC-20**    | Dogecoin      | Dogecoin-specific token standard      |
