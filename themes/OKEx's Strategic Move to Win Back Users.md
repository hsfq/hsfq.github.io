# OKEx's Strategic Move to Win Back Users  

## Introduction: Bitcoin Bonuses and Market Momentum  
In early 2025, OKEx launched a bold campaign to reclaim its position as a leading cryptocurrency exchange. The platform distributed **$100 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC)** in holiday bonuses, coinciding with explosive growth in newly listed assets like **BADGER**, which surged **15x** post-listing. These initiatives underscored OKEx's urgency to stabilize user retention after the lingering impact of its 2021 "withdrawal halt" incident. With competitors like Binance and Huobi aggressively capturing market share, OKEx's strategy hinges on three pillars: **high-potential asset listings**, **system stability during volatile markets**, and **innovative user engagement campaigns**.

## New Listings Driving Growth: BADGER, MIR, and TORN  

### DeFi Gems and Strategic Selection  
OKEx's renewed focus on **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** projects has drawn praise from industry experts. Assets like **MIR** (Mirror Protocol's synthetic asset token) and **TORN** (Tornado Cash's privacy protocol token) exemplify its knack for identifying undervalued opportunities.  

- **MIR**: Listed on January 29, 2025, at $3.29, MIR peaked at $8.30 by February 21, cementing OKEx as the asset's largest trading hub.  
- **TORN**: Launched at $230, TORN doubled to $461 within two days, showcasing demand for privacy-focused solutions.  
- **BADGER**: A standout success, BADGERâ€”a protocol bridging Bitcoin to Ethereum DeFiâ€”soared **15x** from its $5.90 listing price to $91.70 by February 9.  

These listings align with OKEx's mission to offer **"fresh, high-growth assets"** that resonate with traders seeking alpha.  

### Competitive Edge in NFTs: The FLOW Case Study  
OKEx's agility extends to **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**. When Huobi paused **FLOW** (a blockchain for NBA Top Shot) deposits/withdrawals due to technical upgrades, OKEx swiftly listed the asset on February 23, pairing it with a celebrity basketball card promotion. This "reverse takeover" positioned OKEx as FLOW's **second-largest trading platform**, attracting thousands of displaced users.  

**Key Takeaway**: OKEx's proactive asset selection and marketing prowess create a **virtuous cycle** of liquidity and user engagement.

## System Stability During Market Turbulence

**Technical Superiority**:

- **Dynamic Risk Controls**: Advanced algorithms prevent unnecessary liquidations during volatility.

**Quote**: *"A stable system isnâ€™t just about serversâ€”itâ€™s about designing for chaos,"* said an OKEx tech lead.  

### Lessons from the 2021 Withdrawal Halt
