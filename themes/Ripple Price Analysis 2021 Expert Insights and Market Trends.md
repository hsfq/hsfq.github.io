## 2020 Market Performance Review

XRP's price journey in 2020 demonstrated remarkable volatility:

- **March**: $0.14 (Pandemic impact)
- **September**: $0.26 (Pre-lawsuit peak)
- **December**: $0.18 (Post-SEC ruling crash)

- Delisting from major US exchanges
- Market capitalization decline from $10B to $8.5B
