**Price Levels to Watch:**
| Level Type       | Price Range (USD) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Immediate Support| $78,000-$80,000   |

### Market Sentiment Analysis
The cryptocurrency market continues to navigate a transitional phase following prolonged high volatility. While BTC's price has found temporary stability, several factors could reignite volatility:

1. **Breakdown Risk**: A sustained move below $78,000 could trigger renewed selling pressure
2. **Bullish Scenario**:Á™ÅÁ†¥ $92,000 opens path to test historical resistance zones
3. **Cross-Asset Correlation**: Reduced interdependence with traditional markets

### Cross-Market Correlations

The broader financial landscape reveals interesting patterns. S&P 500's leveraged positions and subsequent de-risking created volatility echoes across asset classes. Key market characteristics:

- **VIX Index Trajectory**: Expected to remain elevated above 20s range
- **Market Fatigue**: Diminishing reactions to recurring tariff policy announcements
- **Position Cleaning**: Improved market health through reduced excessive leverage

While BTC demonstrated relative resilience compared to equities, its New York trading session weakness indicates persistent macroeconomic pressures. The subsequent Asian session rebound suggests growing regional market influence.
