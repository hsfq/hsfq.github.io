## Bitcoin Investment Profit/Loss Mechanics  

Bitcoinâ€™s **high volatility** creates both opportunities and risks:  
- **20% price increase**: R$ 1,000 investment becomes R$ 1,200  
- **20% price drop**: Same investment shrinks to R$ 800  

Historically, Bitcoin has experienced **+100% gains in 3-6 months**, but sudden corrections require careful risk management.  

### Strategic Investment Considerations  
1. **Dollar-cost averaging (DCA)**: Mitigate volatility through regular purchases  
2. **Stop-loss orders**: Automatically sell at predetermined price thresholds  
3. **Portfolio diversification**: Balance BTC with stablecoins or altcoins
