# OKX Supports MATIC Token Migration to POL  

## Understanding the MATIC to POL Transition  

OKX, a global leader in cryptocurrency exchange platforms and Web3 infrastructure, has announced official support for the migration of Polygon's native token MATIC to its upgraded version, POL. This transition aligns with Polygon's strategic roadmap to enhance scalability, security, and governance within its ecosystem. The migration process involves critical deadlines for users to manage deposits, withdrawals, and trading activities, ensuring seamless integration of the new token standard.  

### Key Migration Milestones  

The migration framework includes the following pivotal steps:  

- **Pause of MATIC Operations**: Deposits and withdrawals of MATIC tokens on the Polygon PoS Network will be temporarily suspended to facilitate the transition.  
- **POL Activation**: POL deposits and withdrawals will become available on the ERC20 Mainnet in early September, marking the tokenâ€™s official launch.  
- **New Trading Pairs**: Spot trading for POL/USDT and POL/USDC pairs will be introduced, offering users liquidity and trading flexibility.  
- **Legacy Token Phase-Out**: MATIC trading pairs and perpetual futures contracts will be delisted to prioritize POLâ€™s adoption.  
- **Automatic Token Conversion**: User balances of MATIC will be converted to POL at a 1:1 ratio without requiring manual intervention.

### Critical User Actions for Seamless Migration  

To avoid disruptions, OKX recommends the following steps:  

1. **Settle Open Positions**: Close outstanding futures positions and margin trades involving MATIC before the deadline.  
2. **Loan Repayments**: Repay flexible loans collateralized by MATIC to prevent liquidation risks.  
3. **Monitor Deadlines**: Track OKX announcements for exact dates of network suspensions and POL activation.  
4. **Update Wallets**: Ensure compatibility with ERC20 tokens for receiving POL post-migration.  

Adjustments to margin trading parameters and loan terms will occur during the transition period, reflecting the evolving token ecosystem.
