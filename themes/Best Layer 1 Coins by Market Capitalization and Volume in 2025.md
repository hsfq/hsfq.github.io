## Why Market Cap and Volume Matter  

Market capitalization and trading volume are critical metrics for evaluating cryptocurrency projects:  
- **Market Cap** reflects a networkâ€™s overall value and investor confidence.  
- **Trading Volume** indicates liquidity and market activity, with higher volumes often signaling strong community engagement.  

For example, Bitcoinâ€™s dominance in both metrics highlights its status as a store of value, while Solanaâ€™s rising volume suggests growing interest in its high-throughput blockchain.  

## Practical Insights for Investors  

1. **Diversify Across Layers**: While Layer 1 projects form the backbone of crypto, combining them with Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Polygon for Ethereum) can enhance scalability and returns.  
2. **Monitor Volatility**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash (+12.4% 7D) and Kaspa (+1.13% 7D) exhibit significant short-term swings, requiring risk management strategies.  
3. **Research Fundamentals**: Projects like Celestia (+17.6% 7D) and Sonic (+11.99% 7D) may offer growth potential, but thorough due diligence is essential.
