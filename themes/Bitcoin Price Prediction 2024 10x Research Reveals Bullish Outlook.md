### Historical Accuracy of 10x Research Predictions

The research firm has built its reputation on precision, consistently delivering actionable market insights. Their 2024 halving prediction, made in October 2022, achieved 99% accuracy, while the 2023 year-end projection missed actual prices by just 3%. This track record underscores the significance of their current technical indicators showing two critical buy signals:
- August 27 entry at $60,270
- October 14 confirmation at $68,205

| Prediction Period | Target Price | Actual Outcome | Accuracy Margin |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2022 Bull Market Start | $30,000 | $29,730 | +0.9% |
| 2023 Year-End | $65,000 | $63,050 | -3.0% |
| 2024 Halving Period | $70,000 | $69,300 | +1.0% |

### Quant Models Signal New Milestones
